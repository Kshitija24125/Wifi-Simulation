# Wifimodulation
 # WiFi Simulation Project

This project simulates WiFi communication protocols, including **WiFi4** and **WiFi5**, using object-oriented principles in C++. The simulation calculates throughput, average latency, and maximum latency for various configurations of users and rounds. The implementation uses **SFML** for rendering graphical outputs (if applicable).
